    "experience.jobDescription1": "During the internship, I worked with technologies used within Levi9 Technology Services. The task was to create two WebAPIs and services for data synchronization between API services. The team I was part of implemented an authorized WebAPI in the C# programming language (.Net Core WebAPI), along with unit tests (NUnit, Moq), and integration tests.\n\nThe goal of this task was to familiarize myself with the implementation process from the initial request to the final solution. I used Swashbuckle, Swagger, and Postman tools for testing during the implementation. The API was developed following REST API guidelines, and MS SQL Express database was used for data storage, with the schema modeled using Entity Framework.\n\nAfter successfully implementing the API services, I worked on developing a React web application to showcase the functionalities of the implemented backend. Throughout the task, I utilized GIT as a version control system, using branching for each individual task.\n\nThe internship was conducted in a team of 6 students, where we had to collaborate and coordinate the implementation and task allocation.",
